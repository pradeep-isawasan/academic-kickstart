You can dowload the dataset from <https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds>

```{python}
#load the dataset
data = read_csv('diamonds.csv')
#view the dataset
data

{{< figure library="true" src="viewdata.PNG" fig.align = 'left' lightbox="true" >}}

## Summary Statistics
We can use summary statistics to help identify missing or corrupt data.

```{python}
# summarize the dataset
data.describe()
```
{{< figure library="true" src="datadescribe.PNG" align="left" lightbox="true" >}}
